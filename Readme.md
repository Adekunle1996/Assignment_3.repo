creating a function with two parameter that will have two values passed as an argument while a conditional statements will be created to sum up the two value if the two arguments paseed are numbers, if not, if the first agrugment is a not a number while the other is,  the conditional statement should the first value, if not, if the second statement ia not a number and the first statement is, the second argument should be return. while, if the argument dose not suit any of the conditon above the conditional statement should return zero.
how to solve this
step1:creating a function with name.
step2:create a condtional statement that will the define all the four statement above inside the function.
step3:call the function and then pass in two argument.
